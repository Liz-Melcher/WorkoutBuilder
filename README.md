# WorkoutBuilder

Ask user for:
  - goal total laps
  - starting laps (minimum step)
  - increment (how fast to climb the pyramid)
  - match type (<= or >=)

Initialize peak to starting laps

While True:
  Build pyramid: climb up from start to peak by increment, then down
  For each step in pyramid:
    Add step laps of work
    Add 1 lap rest
  Calculate total laps (work + rest)

  If match type condition is met (>= or <=):
    break
  Else:
    peak += increment

Print pyramid plan
Print total laps


es — you're thinking like a developer now. 👏
You're seeing shared inputs and logic between two workflows:
🔁 Shared Concepts Across Both Modes
Feature	Used In "From Goal"	Used In "From Base"	Shared
increment	✅	✅	✅
rest_laps_per_set	✅	✅	✅
start (starting reps)	✅	✅	✅
peak (max reps)	❌ (calculated)	✅	
goal_total_laps	✅	❌	
match type (>=, <=)	✅	❌	
🧱 Suggested Refactor: A Unified Structure

Split the app like this:
1. Core Logic (Shared) in a pyramid_utils.py:

    build_pyramid(start, peak, increment)

    total_laps(pyramid, rest_laps_per_set)

    Maybe: validate_inputs()

2. CLI Entry Points:

    pyramid_from_goal.py

    pyramid_from_base.py

Each one:

    Handles its specific inputs (goal vs peak)

    Calls the shared logic



Nice! That’s a solid, modern stack choice. Here’s how you could think about building your workout app with React or Vue frontend, Django backend, and MongoDB or SQL database:

---

### 1. **Frontend (React or Vue)**

* Build your workout builder UI as reusable components:

  * Form for creating/editing pyramid workouts (start, peak, increment, rest, unit type)
  * Workout logging screen (select workout, enter actual reps/time, add notes)
  * Workout history view with filter and search
* Use **React Router** or **Vue Router** to navigate between views
* Store frontend state with React’s Context API, Redux, or Vuex (if complex)
* Fetch/post data via REST API (or GraphQL if you want)

---

### 2. **Backend (Django)**

* Use **Django REST Framework (DRF)** to build REST API endpoints:

  * Authentication endpoints (login, signup, logout, user profiles)
  * CRUD endpoints for Workouts and Logs
* Integrate with authentication packages (e.g., **django-allauth**, **djoser**) for user management
* Add permissions so users can only see/edit their own workouts and logs

---

### 3. **Database**

* MongoDB (NoSQL):

  * Great for flexible schema — workout steps could be an embedded array
  * Use **Djongo** or a separate service like **MongoEngine** to integrate MongoDB with Django
* SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL):

  * Well-supported in Django, great for relational data
  * Use Django’s built-in ORM, define models for Workout, Log, User, etc.
* Since you said Mongo is your first choice but SQL is backup:

  * Start with SQL for ease of Django integration
  * Switch to Mongo later if you want more schema flexibility or scale

---

### 4. **Data Model Ideas**

* **Workout Model**

  * user (FK)
  * name
  * start
  * peak
  * increment
  * rest
  * unit\_type ('laps' or 'time')
  * created\_at, updated\_at

* **WorkoutLog Model**

  * user (FK)
  * workout (FK)
  * date\_performed
  * actual\_pyramid\_steps (store array or JSON)
  * notes (text)
  * created\_at

---

### 5. **Additional Features to Consider**

* User profile/dashboard with stats and progress charts (React Chart.js or similar)
* Social sharing or community workouts (if you want a social feature)
* Notifications or reminders
* Exporting logs as CSV or PDF
* Mobile-friendly responsive UI or separate React Native app later

---

### 6. **Development Approach**

* Start by building the backend API (Django + DB models)
* Create endpoints and test them with tools like Postman
* Build frontend components with static/mock data
* Connect frontend to backend with API calls
* Add authentication and authorization
* Iterate with user feedback

---

If you want, I can help you:

* Sketch out your Django models and serializers
* Write example API views and routes
* Design React or Vue components structure and example code
* Suggest deployment strategies (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, DigitalOcean)

Would you like to start with the **Django backend model and API design**, or jump right into **frontend UI design**?
